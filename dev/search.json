Confidence level use build confidence interval. type string indicates type (scale) predictions used compute marginal effects contrasts. can differ based model type, typically string : \"response\", \"link\", \"probs\", \"zero\". unsupported string entered, model-specific list acceptable values returned error message. type NULL, default value used. default first model-related row marginaleffects:::type_dictionary dataframe. type NULL default value \"response\", function tries compute marginal means link scale backtransforming using inverse link function. transform_post (experimental) function applied unit-level adjusted predictions confidence intervals just function returns results. bayesian models, function applied individual draws posterior distribution, computing summaries. cross TRUE FALSE FALSE (default): Marginal means computed predictor individually. TRUE: Marginal means computed combination predictors specified variables argument. hypothesis specify hypothesis test custom contrast using numeric value, vector, matrix, string, string formula. Numeric: Single value: null hypothesis used computation Z p (applying transform_post). Vector: Weights compute linear combination (custom contrast ) estimates. Length equal number rows generated function call, without hypothesis argument. Matrix: column vector weights, describe , used compute distinct linear combination (contrast ) estimates. column names matrix used labels output. String formula specify linear non-linear hypothesis tests. term column uniquely identifies rows, terms can used formula. Otherwise, use b1, b2, etc. identify position parameter.
