# Comparisons

In this vignette, we introduce “comparisons”, defined as:

> Compare the predictions made by a model for different regressor values
> (e.g., college graduates vs. others): contrasts, differences, risk
> ratios, odds, etc.

The `comparisons()` function is *extremely* flexible, and it allows
users to estimate a vast array of quantities of interest. To describe
those quantities, we will break the problem up in 4 steps:

1.  Quantity
2.  Grid
3.  Average
4.  Hypothesis

These steps can be combined and mixed and matched to define and compute
many different estimands.

## Simple example: Titanic

Consider a logistic regression model estimated using the Titanic
mortality data:

``` r
library(marginaleffects)

dat <- "https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/Stat2Data/Titanic.csv"
dat <- read.csv(dat)
dat$PClass[dat$PClass == "*"] <- NA
mod <- glm(Survived ~ PClass * SexCode * Age, data = dat, family = binomial)
```

### Step 1: Quantity

The question that interests us is:

> How does the probability of survival (outcome) change if a passenger
> travels in 1st class vs. 3rd class?

Since we are comparing two predicted outcomes, we will use
`comparisons()`. To indicate that our focal variable is `PClass` and
that we are interested in the comparison between 1st and 3rd class, we
will use the `variables` argument:

``` r
comparisons(mod,
  variables = list(PClass = c("1st", "3rd"))) # Step 1: Quantity
```

### Step 2: Grid

In GLM models, most quantities of interest are *conditional*, in the
sense that they will typically depend on the values of all the
predictors in the model. Therefore, we need to decide *where* in the
predictor space we want to evaluate the quantity of interest described
above.

By default, `comparisons()` will compute estimates for every row of the
original dataset that was used to fit a model. There are 1313
observations in the titanic dataset. Therefore, if we just execute the
code in the previous section, we will obtain 1313 estimates of the
difference between the probability of survival in 3rd and 1st class:

``` r
comparisons(mod,
  variables = list(PClass = c("1st", "3rd"))) # Step 1: Quantity
#> 
#>    Term  Contrast Estimate Std. Error     z Pr(>|z|)    S  2.5 % 97.5 %
#>  PClass 3rd - 1st   -0.496     0.0610 -8.13  < 0.001 51.0 -0.616 -0.376
#>  PClass 3rd - 1st   -0.472     0.1247 -3.79  < 0.001 12.7 -0.716 -0.228
#>  PClass 3rd - 1st   -0.353     0.0641 -5.51  < 0.001 24.7 -0.478 -0.227
#>  PClass 3rd - 1st   -0.493     0.0583 -8.45  < 0.001 55.0 -0.607 -0.379
#>  PClass 3rd - 1st   -0.445     0.1452 -3.07  0.00216  8.9 -0.730 -0.161
#> --- 746 rows omitted. See ?avg_comparisons and ?print.marginaleffects --- 
#>  PClass 3rd - 1st   -0.377     0.0703 -5.36  < 0.001 23.5 -0.515 -0.239
#>  PClass 3rd - 1st   -0.384     0.0726 -5.30  < 0.001 23.0 -0.527 -0.242
#>  PClass 3rd - 1st   -0.412     0.0821 -5.02  < 0.001 20.9 -0.573 -0.251
#>  PClass 3rd - 1st   -0.399     0.0773 -5.16  < 0.001 22.0 -0.550 -0.247
#>  PClass 3rd - 1st   -0.361     0.0661 -5.47  < 0.001 24.4 -0.490 -0.232
#> Columns: rowid, term, contrast, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high, predicted_lo, predicted_hi, predicted, Survived, PClass, SexCode, Age 
#> Type:  response
```

Notice that the contrast between 3rd and 1st is different from row to
row. This reflects the fact that, in our model, moving from 1st to 3rd
would have a different effect on the predicted probability of survival
for different individuals.

We can be more specific in our query. Instead of using the empirical
distribution as our “grid”, we can specify exactly where we want to
evaluate the comparison in the predictor space, by using the `newdata`
argument and the `datagrid()` function. For example, say I am interested
in:

> The effect of moving from 1st to 3rd class on the probability of
> survival for a 50 year old man and a 50 year old woman.

I can type:

``` r
cmp <- comparisons(mod,
  variables = list(PClass = c("1st", "3rd")),  # Step 1: Quantity
  newdata = datagrid(Age = 50, SexCode = 0:1)) # Step 2: Grid
cmp
#> 
#>    Term  Contrast Age SexCode Estimate Std. Error     z Pr(>|z|)    S  2.5 %  97.5 % PClass
#>  PClass 3rd - 1st  50       0   -0.184     0.0535 -3.45   <0.001 10.8 -0.289 -0.0796    3rd
#>  PClass 3rd - 1st  50       1   -0.511     0.1242 -4.12   <0.001 14.7 -0.755 -0.2679    3rd
#> 
#> Columns: rowid, term, contrast, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high, Age, SexCode, predicted_lo, predicted_hi, predicted, Survived, PClass 
#> Type:  response
```

We now know that moving from 1st to 3rd changes by -0.184 the
probability of survival for 50 year old men (`SexCode=0`), and by -0.511
the probability of survival for 50 year old women (`SexCode=1`).

### Step 3: Averaging

Again, by default `comparisons()` estimates quantities for all the
actually observed units in our dataset. Sometimes, it is convenient to
marginalize those conditional estimates, in order to obtain an “average
contrast”:

``` r
avg_comparisons(mod,                          # Step 3: Average
  variables = list(PClass = c("1st", "3rd"))) # Step 1: Quantity
#> 
#>    Term  Contrast Estimate Std. Error    z Pr(>|z|)    S  2.5 % 97.5 %
#>  PClass 3rd - 1st   -0.396     0.0425 -9.3   <0.001 66.0 -0.479 -0.312
#> 
#> Columns: term, contrast, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high 
#> Type:  response
```

Alternatively, we could also take the average, but just of the two
estimates that we computed above for the 50 year old man and 50 year old
woman.

``` r
avg_comparisons(mod,                           # Step 3: Average
  variables = list(PClass = c("1st", "3rd")),  # Step 1: Quantity
  newdata = datagrid(Age = 50, SexCode = 0:1)) # Step 2: Grid
#> 
#>    Term  Contrast Estimate Std. Error     z Pr(>|z|)    S 2.5 % 97.5 %
#>  PClass 3rd - 1st   -0.348     0.0676 -5.15   <0.001 21.8 -0.48 -0.215
#> 
#> Columns: term, contrast, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high 
#> Type:  response
```

Notice that this is exactly the same as the average in the estimates
from the previous section, which we had stored as `cmp`:

``` r
cmp$estimate
#> [1] -0.1844289 -0.5113098

mean(cmp$estimate)
#> [1] -0.3478694
```

### Hypothesis

Finally, imagine we are interested in this question:

> Does moving from 1st to 3rd class have a bigger effect on the
> probability of survival for 50 year old men, or for 50 year old women?

To answer this, we use the `hypothesis` argument:

``` r
comparisons(mod,
  variables = list(PClass = c("1st", "3rd")),  # Step 1: Quantity
  newdata = datagrid(Age = 50, SexCode = 0:1), # Step 2: Grid
  hypothesis = "b1 = b2")                      # Step 4: Hypothesis
#> 
#>   Term Estimate Std. Error    z Pr(>|z|)   S  2.5 % 97.5 %
#>  b1=b2    0.327      0.135 2.42   0.0156 6.0 0.0618  0.592
#> 
#> Columns: term, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high 
#> Type:  response
```

This result maps directly onto the estimates we had above. It is the
difference in the contrast for 50-men and 50-women:

``` r
diff(cmp$estimate)
#> [1] -0.3268809
```

This result can be interpreted as a “difference-in-differences”: Moving
from 1st to 3rd has a much larger negative effect on the probability of
survival for a 50 year old woman than for a 50 year old man. This
difference is statistically significant.

We can do a similar comparison, but instead of fixing a conditional
grid, we can average over subgroups of the empirical distribution, using
the `by` argument:

``` r
avg_comparisons(mod,
  variables = list(PClass = c("1st", "3rd")),  # Step 1: Quantity
  by = "SexCode",                              # Step 3: Average
  hypothesis = "b1 = b2")                      # Step 4: Hypothesis
#> 
#>   Term Estimate Std. Error    z Pr(>|z|)   S    2.5 % 97.5 %
#>  b1=b2    0.162     0.0845 1.91   0.0558 4.2 -0.00402  0.327
#> 
#> Columns: term, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high 
#> Type:  response
```

### Manual computation

Now we show how to use the base `R` `predict()` function to compute some
of the same quantities as above. This exercise may be clarifying for
some users.

``` r
grid_50_1_3 <- data.frame(Age = 50, SexCode = 1, PClass = "3rd")
grid_50_1_1 <- data.frame(Age = 50, SexCode = 1, PClass = "1st")
grid_50_0_3 <- data.frame(Age = 50, SexCode = 0, PClass = "3rd")
grid_50_0_1 <- data.frame(Age = 50, SexCode = 0, PClass = "1st")


yhat_50_1_3 <- predict(mod, newdata = grid_50_1_3, type = "response")
yhat_50_1_1 <- predict(mod, newdata = grid_50_1_1, type = "response")
yhat_50_0_3 <- predict(mod, newdata = grid_50_0_3, type = "response")

## Predictor types

### Logical and factor predictors

Consider a simple model with a logical and a factor variable:

``` r
library(marginaleffects)

tmp <- mtcars
tmp$am <- as.logical(tmp$am)
mod <- lm(mpg ~ am + factor(cyl), tmp)
```

The `comparisons` function automatically computes contrasts for each
level of the categorical variables, relative to the baseline category
(`FALSE` for logicals, and the reference level for factors), while
holding all other values at their observed values. The
`avg_comparisons()` does the same, but then marginalizes by taking the
average of unit-level estimates:

``` r
cmp <- avg_comparisons(mod)
cmp
#> 
#>  Term     Contrast Estimate Std. Error     z Pr(>|z|)    S    2.5 % 97.5 %
#>   am  TRUE - FALSE     2.56       1.30  1.97   0.0485  4.4   0.0167   5.10
#>   cyl 6 - 4           -6.16       1.54 -4.01   <0.001 14.0  -9.1661  -3.15
#>   cyl 8 - 4          -10.07       1.45 -6.93   <0.001 37.8 -12.9136  -7.22
#> 
#> Columns: term, contrast, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high 
#> Type:  response
```

The summary printed above says that moving from the reference category
`4` to the level `6` on the `cyl` factor variable is associated with a
change of -6.156 in the adjusted prediction. Similarly, the contrast
from `FALSE` to `TRUE` on the `am` variable is equal to 2.560.

We can obtain different contrasts by using the `comparisons()` function.
For example:

``` r
avg_comparisons(mod, variables = list(cyl = "sequential"))
#> 
#>  Term Contrast Estimate Std. Error     z Pr(>|z|)    S 2.5 % 97.5 %
#>   cyl    6 - 4    -6.16       1.54 -4.01  < 0.001 14.0 -9.17  -3.15
#>   cyl    8 - 6    -3.91       1.47 -2.66  0.00781  7.0 -6.79  -1.03
#> 
#> Columns: term, contrast, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high 
#> Type:  response

avg_comparisons(mod, variables = list(cyl = "pairwise"))
#> 
#>  Term Contrast Estimate Std. Error     z Pr(>|z|)    S  2.5 % 97.5 %
#>   cyl    6 - 4    -6.16       1.54 -4.01  < 0.001 14.0  -9.17  -3.15
#>   cyl    8 - 4   -10.07       1.45 -6.93  < 0.001 37.8 -12.91  -7.22
#>   cyl    8 - 6    -3.91       1.47 -2.66  0.00781  7.0  -6.79  -1.03
#> 
#> Columns: term, contrast, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high 
#> Type:  response

avg_comparisons(mod, variables = list(cyl = "reference"))
#> 
#>  Term Contrast Estimate Std. Error     z Pr(>|z|)    S  2.5 % 97.5 %
#>   cyl    6 - 4    -6.16       1.54 -4.01   <0.001 14.0  -9.17  -3.15
#>   cyl    8 - 4   -10.07       1.45 -6.93   <0.001 37.8 -12.91  -7.22
#> 
#> Columns: term, contrast, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high 
#> Type:  response
```

For comparison, this code produces the same results using the `emmeans`
package:

``` r
library(emmeans)
emm <- emmeans(mod, specs = "cyl")
contrast(emm, method = "revpairwise")
#>  contrast    estimate   SE df t.ratio p.value
#>  cyl6 - cyl4    -6.16 1.54 28  -4.009  0.0012
#>  cyl8 - cyl4   -10.07 1.45 28  -6.933  <.0001
#>  cyl8 - cyl6    -3.91 1.47 28  -2.660  0.0331
#> 
#> Results are averaged over the levels of: am 
#> P value adjustment: tukey method for comparing a family of 3 estimates

emm <- emmeans(mod, specs = "am")
contrast(emm, method = "revpairwise")
#>  contrast     estimate  SE df t.ratio p.value
#>  TRUE - FALSE     2.56 1.3 28   1.973  0.0585
#> 
#> Results are averaged over the levels of: cyl
```

Note that these commands also work on for other types of models, such as
GLMs, on different scales:

``` r
mod_logit <- glm(am ~ factor(gear), data = mtcars, family = binomial)

avg_comparisons(mod_logit)
#> 
#>  Term Contrast Estimate Std. Error       z Pr(>|z|)    S 2.5 % 97.5 %

#### Observation-Wise Categorical Marginal Effect

For categorical predictors, [Scholbeck et
al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.08837.pdf) recommend that analysts
report what they call the “observation-wise categorical marginal
effects.” They describe the procedure as follows:

> Recall that the common definition of categorical MEs is based on first
> changing all observations’ value of *x*<sub>*j*</sub> to each category
> and then computing the difference in predictions when changing it to
> the reference category. However, one is often interested in prediction
> changes if aspects of an actual observation change. We therefore
> propose an observation-wise categorical ME. We first select a single
> reference category *c*<sub>*h*</sub>. For each observation whose
> feature value *x*<sub>*j*</sub> ≠ *c*<sub>*h*</sub>, we predict once
> with the observed value *x*<sub>*j*</sub> and once where
> *x*<sub>*j*</sub> has been replaced by *c*<sub>*h*</sub>.

To achieve this with `marginaleffects`, we proceed in three simple
steps:

1.  Use the `factor()` function to set the reference level of the
    categorical variable.
2.  Use the `newdata` argument to take the subset of data where the
    observed *x*<sub>*j*</sub> is different from the reference level we
    picked in 1.
3.  Apply the `avg_comparisons()` with the `"revreference"` option.

``` r
dat <- transform(mtcars, cyl = factor(cyl, levels = c(6, 4, 8)))

mod <- glm(vs ~ mpg * factor(cyl), data = dat, family = binomial)

avg_comparisons(mod,
  variables = list(cyl = "revreference"),
  newdata = subset(dat, cyl != 6))

```

### Character predictors

All functions of the `marginaleffects` package attempt to treat
character predictors as factor predictors. However, using factors
instead of characters when modeling is *strongly* encouraged, because
they are much safer and faster. This is because factors hold useful
information about the full list of levels, which makes them easier to
track and handle internally by `marginaleffects`. Users are strongly
encouraged to convert their character variables to factor before fitting
their models and using `slopes` functions.

### Numeric predictors

We can also compute contrasts for differences in numeric variables. For
example, we can see what happens to the adjusted predictions when we
increment the `hp` variable by 1 unit (default) or by 5 units about the
original value:

``` r
mod <- lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)

avg_comparisons(mod)
#> 
#>  Term Contrast Estimate Std. Error     z Pr(>|z|)    S   2.5 %  97.5 %
#>    hp       +1  -0.0682     0.0101 -6.74   <0.001 35.9 -0.0881 -0.0484
#> 
#> Columns: term, contrast, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high 
#> Type:  response

avg_comparisons(mod, variables = list(hp = 5))
#> 
#>  Term Contrast Estimate Std. Error     z Pr(>|z|)    S 2.5 % 97.5 %
#>    hp       +5   -0.341     0.0506 -6.74   <0.001 35.9 -0.44 -0.242
#> 
#> Columns: term, contrast, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high 
#> Type:  response
```

Compare adjusted predictions for a change in the regressor between two
arbitrary values:

``` r
avg_comparisons(mod, variables = list(hp = c(90, 110)))
#> 
#>  Term Contrast Estimate Std. Error     z Pr(>|z|)    S 2.5 % 97.5 %
#>    hp 110 - 90    -1.36      0.202 -6.74   <0.001 35.9 -1.76 -0.968
#> 
#> Columns: term, contrast, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high 
#> Type:  response
```

Compare adjusted predictions when the regressor changes across the
interquartile range, across one or two standard deviations about its
mean, or from across its full range:

``` r
avg_comparisons(mod, variables = list(hp = "iqr"))
#> 
#>  Term Contrast Estimate Std. Error     z Pr(>|z|)    S 2.5 % 97.5 %
#>    hp  Q3 - Q1     -5.7      0.845 -6.74   <0.001 35.9 -7.35  -4.04
#> 
#> Columns: term, contrast, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high 
#> Type:  response

avg_comparisons(mod, variables = list(hp = "sd"))
#> 
#>  Term                Contrast Estimate Std. Error     z Pr(>|z|)    S 2.5 % 97.5 %
#>    hp (x + sd/2) - (x - sd/2)    -4.68      0.694 -6.74   <0.001 35.9 -6.04  -3.32
#> 
#> Columns: term, contrast, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high 
#> Type:  response

avg_comparisons(mod, variables = list(hp = "2sd"))
#> 
#>  Term            Contrast Estimate Std. Error     z Pr(>|z|)    S 2.5 % 97.5 %
#>    hp (x + sd) - (x - sd)    -9.36       1.39 -6.74   <0.001 35.9 -12.1  -6.64
#> 
#> Columns: term, contrast, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high 
#> Type:  response

avg_comparisons(mod, variables = list(hp = "minmax"))
#> 
#>  Term  Contrast Estimate Std. Error     z Pr(>|z|)    S 2.5 % 97.5 %
#>    hp Max - Min    -19.3       2.86 -6.74   <0.001 35.9 -24.9  -13.7
#> 
#> Columns: term, contrast, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high 
#> Type:  response
```

## Interactions and Cross-Contrasts

In some contexts we are interested in whether the “effect” of a variable
changes, as a function of another variable. A very simple strategy to
tackle this question is to estimate a model with a multiplicative
interaction like this one:

``` r
mod <- lm(mpg ~ am * factor(cyl), data = mtcars)
```

Calling `avg_comparisons()` with the `by` argument shows that the
estimated comparisons differ based on `cyl`:

``` r
avg_comparisons(mod, variables = "am", by = "cyl")
#> 
#>  Term          Contrast cyl Estimate Std. Error     z Pr(>|z|)   S 2.5 % 97.5 %
#>    am mean(1) - mean(0)   4     5.18       2.05 2.521   0.0117 6.4  1.15   9.20
#>    am mean(1) - mean(0)   6     1.44       2.32 0.623   0.5336 0.9 -3.10   5.98
#>    am mean(1) - mean(0)   8     0.35       2.32 0.151   0.8799 0.2 -4.19   4.89
#> 
#> Columns: term, contrast, cyl, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high, predicted_lo, predicted_hi, predicted 
#> Type:  response
```

However, using the `hypothesis` argument for pairwise contrasts between
the above comparisons reveals that the heterogeneity is not
statistically significant:

``` r
avg_comparisons(mod, variables = "am", by = "cyl", hypothesis = "pairwise")
#> 
#>   Term Estimate Std. Error     z Pr(>|z|)   S 2.5 % 97.5 %
#>  4 - 6     3.73       3.09 1.206    0.228 2.1 -2.33   9.80
#>  4 - 8     4.82       3.09 1.559    0.119 3.1 -1.24  10.89
#>  6 - 8     1.09       3.28 0.333    0.739 0.4 -5.33   7.51
#> 
#> Columns: term, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high 
#> Type:  response
```

In other contexts, we are interested in a “cross-contrast” or
“cross-comparisons”; we would like to know what happens when two (or
more) predictors change at the same time. To assess this, we can specify
the regressors of interest in the `variables` argument, and set the
`cross=TRUE`:

``` r
avg_comparisons(mod, variables = c("cyl", "am"), cross = TRUE)
#> 
#>  Estimate Std. Error      z Pr(>|z|)   S  2.5 % 97.5 % C: am C: cyl
#>     -2.33       2.48 -0.942  0.34596 1.5  -7.19   2.52 1 - 0  6 - 4
#>     -7.50       2.77 -2.709  0.00674 7.2 -12.93  -2.07 1 - 0  8 - 4
#> 
#> Columns: term, contrast_am, contrast_cyl, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high 
#> Type:  response
```

## Quantities of interest

This section compares 4 quantities:

1.  Unit-Level Contrasts
2.  Average Contrast
3.  Contrast at the Mean
4.  Contrast Between Marginal Means

The ideas discussed in this section focus on contrasts, but they carry
over directly to analogous types of marginal effects.

### Unit-level contrasts

In models with interactions or non-linear components (e.g., link
function), the value of a contrast or marginal effect can depend on the
value of all the predictors in the model. As a result, contrasts and
marginal effects are fundamentally *unit-level* quantities. The effect
of a 1 unit increase in *X* can be different for Mary or John. Every row
of a dataset has a different contrast and marginal effect.

The `mtcars` dataset has 32 rows, so the `comparisons()` function
produces 32 contrast estimates:

``` r
library(marginaleffects)
mod <- glm(vs ~ factor(gear) + mpg, family = binomial, data = mtcars)
cmp <- comparisons(mod, variables = "mpg")
nrow(cmp)
#> [1] 32
```

### Average contrasts

By default, the `slopes()` and `comparisons()` functions compute
marginal effects and contrasts for every row of the original dataset.
These unit-level estimates can be of great interest, as discussed in
[another vignette](logit.html). Nevertheless, one may want to focus on
one-number summaries: the `avg_*()` functions or the `by` argument
compute the “Average Marginal Effect” or “Average Contrast,” by taking
the mean of all the unit-level estimates.

``` r
avg_comparisons(mod, variables = "mpg")
#> 
#>  Term Contrast Estimate Std. Error    z Pr(>|z|)    S  2.5 % 97.5 %
#>   mpg       +1   0.0609     0.0128 4.78   <0.001 19.1 0.0359 0.0859
#> 
#> Columns: term, contrast, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high 
#> Type:  response

comparisons(mod, variables = "mpg", by = TRUE)
#> 
#>  Term Contrast Estimate Std. Error    z Pr(>|z|)    S  2.5 % 97.5 %
#>   mpg       +1   0.0609     0.0128 4.78   <0.001 19.1 0.0359 0.0859
#> 
#> Columns: term, contrast, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high 
#> Type:  response
```

which are equivalent to:

``` r
mean(cmp$estimate)
#> [1] 0.06091377
```

We could also show the full distribution of contrasts across our dataset
with a histogram:

``` r
library(ggplot2)

cmp <- comparisons(mod, variables = "gear")

ggplot(cmp, aes(estimate)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 30) +
    facet_wrap(~contrast, scale = "free_x") +
    labs(x = "Distribution of unit-level contrasts")
```

![](comparisons.markdown_strict_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-29-1.png)

This graph displays the effect of a change of 1 unit in the `gear`
variable, for each individual in the observed data.

### Contrasts at the mean

An alternative which used to be very common but has now fallen into a
bit of disfavor is to compute “Contrasts at the mean.” The idea is to
create a “synthetic” or “hypothetical” individual (row of the dataset)
whose characteristics are completely average. Then, we compute and
report the contrast for this specific hypothetical individual.

This can be achieved by setting `newdata="mean"` or to
`newdata=datagrid()`, both of which fix variables to their means or
modes:

``` r
comparisons(mod, variables = "mpg", newdata = "mean")
#> 
#>  Term Contrast Estimate Std. Error    z Pr(>|z|)   S  2.5 % 97.5 % gear  mpg
#>   mpg       +1    0.155     0.0539 2.88  0.00399 8.0 0.0495  0.261    3 20.1
#> 
#> Columns: rowid, term, contrast, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high, predicted_lo, predicted_hi, predicted, vs, gear, mpg 
#> Type:  response
```

Contrasts at the mean can differ substantially from average contrasts.

The advantage of this approach is that it is very cheap and fast
computationally. The disadvantage is that the interpretation is somewhat
ambiguous. Often times, there simply does not exist an individual who is
perfectly average across all dimensions of the dataset. It is also not
clear why the analyst should be particularly interested in the contrast
for this one, synthetic, perfectly average individual.

### Contrasts between marginal means

Yet another type of contrast is the “Contrast between marginal means.”
This type of contrast is closely related to the “Contrast at the mean”,
with a few wrinkles. It is the default approach used by the `emmeans`
package for `R`.

Roughly speaking, the procedure is as follows:

1.  Create a prediction grid with one cell for each combination of
    categorical predictors in the model, and all numeric variables held
    at their means.
2.  Make adjusted predictions in each cell of the prediction grid.
3.  Take the average of those predictions (marginal means) for each
    combination of `btype` (focal variable) and `resp` (group `by`
    variable).
4.  Compute pairwise differences (contrasts) in marginal means across
    different levels of the focal variable `btype`.

The contrast obtained through this approach has two critical
characteristics:

1.  It is the contrast for a synthetic individual with perfectly average
    qualities on every (numeric) predictor.
2.  It is a weighted average of unit-level contrasts, where weights
    assume a perfectly balanced dataset across every categorical
    predictor.

With respect to (a), the analyst should ask themselves: Is my quantity
of interest the contrast for a perfectly average hypothetical
individual? With respect to (b), the analyst should ask themselves: Is
my quantity of interest the contrast in a model estimated using
(potentially) unbalanced data, but interpreted *as if* the data were
perfectly balanced?

For example, imagine that one of the control variables in your model is
a variable measuring educational attainment in 4 categories: No high
school, High school, Some college, Completed college. The contrast
between marginal is a weighted average of contrasts estimated in the 4
cells, and each of those contrasts will be weighted equally in the
overall estimate. If the population of interest is highly unbalanced in
the educational categories, then the estimate computed in this way will
not be most useful.

If the contrasts between marginal means is really the quantity of
interest, it is easy to use the `comparisons()` to estimate contrasts
between marginal means. The `newdata` determines the values of the
predictors at which we want to compute contrasts. We can set
`newdata="marginalmeans"` to emulate the `emmeans` behavior. For
example, here we compute contrasts in a model with an interaction:

``` r
dat <- read.csv("https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/palmerpenguins/penguins.csv")
mod <- lm(bill_length_mm ~ species * sex + island + body_mass_g, data = dat)

avg_comparisons(
    mod,
    newdata = "marginalmeans",
    variables = c("species", "island"))
#> 
#>     Term           Contrast Estimate Std. Error      z Pr(>|z|)     S  2.5 % 97.5 %
#>  island  Dream - Biscoe       -0.434      0.451 -0.962    0.336   1.6 -1.318  0.450
#>  island  Torgersen - Biscoe    0.060      0.467  0.128    0.898   0.2 -0.856  0.976
#>  species Chinstrap - Adelie   10.563      0.418 25.272   <0.001 465.7  9.744 11.382
#>  species Gentoo - Adelie       5.792      0.798  7.257   <0.001  41.2  4.228  7.356
#> 
#> Columns: term, contrast, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high 
#> Type:  response
```

Which is equivalent to this in `emmeans`:

``` r
emm <- emmeans(
    mod,
    specs = c("species", "island"))
contrast(emm, method = "trt.vs.ctrl1")
#>  contrast                            estimate    SE  df t.ratio p.value
#>  Chinstrap Biscoe - Adelie Biscoe      nonEst    NA  NA      NA      NA
#>  Gentoo Biscoe - Adelie Biscoe          5.792 0.798 331   7.257  <.0001
#>  Adelie Dream - Adelie Biscoe          -0.434 0.451 331  -0.962  0.7573
#>  Chinstrap Dream - Adelie Biscoe       nonEst    NA  NA      NA      NA
#>  Gentoo Dream - Adelie Biscoe           5.358 1.035 331   5.177  <.0001
#>  Adelie Torgersen - Adelie Biscoe       0.060 0.467 331   0.128  0.9987
#>  Chinstrap Torgersen - Adelie Biscoe   nonEst    NA  NA      NA      NA
#>  Gentoo Torgersen - Adelie Biscoe       5.852 1.070 331   5.468  <.0001
#> 
#> Results are averaged over the levels of: sex 
#> P value adjustment: dunnettx method for 5 tests
```

The [`emmeans` section of the Alternative Software
vignette](alternative_software.html#emmeans) shows further examples.

The [excellent vignette of the `emmeans`
package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=emmeans/vignettes/basics.html)
discuss the same issues in a slightly different (and more positive) way:

> The point is that the marginal means of cell.means give equal weight
> to each cell. In many situations (especially with experimental data),
> that is a much fairer way to compute marginal means, in that they are
> not biased by imbalances in the data. We are, in a sense, estimating
> what the marginal means would be, had the experiment been balanced.
> Estimated marginal means (EMMs) serve that need.

> All this said, there are certainly situations where equal weighting is
> not appropriate. Suppose, for example, we have data on sales of a
> product given different packaging and features. The data could be
> unbalanced because customers are more attracted to some combinations
> than others. If our goal is to understand scientifically what
> packaging and features are inherently more profitable, then equally
> weighted EMMs may be appropriate; but if our goal is to predict or
> maximize profit, the ordinary marginal means provide better estimates
> of what we can expect in the marketplace.

## Conditional contrasts

Consider a model with an interaction term. What happens to the dependent
variable when the `hp` variable increases by 10 units?

``` r
library(marginaleffects)

mod <- lm(mpg ~ hp * wt, data = mtcars)

plot_comparisons(
    mod,
    variables = list(hp = 10),
    condition = "wt")
```

![](comparisons.markdown_strict_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-33-1.png)

## Transformations

So far we have focused on simple differences between adjusted
predictions. Now, we show how to use ratios, back transformations, and
arbitrary functions to estimate a slew of quantities of interest.
Powerful transformations and custom contrasts are made possible by using
three arguments which act at different stages of the computation
process:

-   `comparison`
-   `transform`

Consider the case of a model with a single predictor *x*. To compute
average contrasts, we proceed as follows:

1.  Compute adjusted predictions for each row of the dataset for the
    observed values *x*: *ŷ*<sub>*x*</sub>
2.  Compute adjusted predictions for each row of the dataset for the
    observed values *x* + 1: *ŷ*<sub>*x* + 1</sub>
3.  `comparison`: Compute unit-level contrasts by taking the difference
    between (or some other function of) adjusted predictions:
    *ŷ*<sub>*x* + 1</sub> − *ŷ*<sub>*x*</sub>
4.  Compute the average contrast by taking the mean of unit-level
    contrasts: $1/N \sum\_{i=1}^N \hat{y}\_{x+1} - \hat{y}\_x$
5.  `transform`: Transform the average contrast or return them as-is.

The `comparison` argument of the `comparisons()` function determines how
adjusted predictions are combined to create a contrast. By default, we
take a simple difference between predictions with `hi` value of *x*, and
predictions with a `lo` value of *x*: `function(hi, lo) hi-lo`.

The `transform` argument of the `comparisons()` function applies a
custom transformation to the unit-level contrasts.

The `transform` argument applies a custom transformation to the final
quantity, as would be returned if we evaluated the same call without
`transform`.

## Differences

The default contrast calculate by the `comparisons()` function is a
(untransformed) difference between two adjusted predictions. For
instance, to estimate the effect of a change of 1 unit, we do:

``` r
library(marginaleffects)

mod <- glm(vs ~ mpg, data = mtcars, family = binomial)

## construct data

mtcars_minus <- mtcars_plus <- mtcars
mtcars_minus$mpg <- mtcars_minus$mpg - 0.5
mtcars_plus$mpg <- mtcars_plus$mpg + 0.5

## adjusted predictions
yhat_minus <- predict(mod, newdata = mtcars_minus, type = "response")
yhat_plus <- predict(mod, newdata = mtcars_plus, type = "response")

## unit-level contrasts
con <- yhat_plus - yhat_minus

## average contrasts
mean(con)
#> [1] 0.05540227
```

We can use the `avg_comparisons()` function , or the `by` argument to
obtain the same results:

``` r
avg_comparisons(mod)
#> 
#>  Term Contrast Estimate Std. Error    z Pr(>|z|)    S  2.5 % 97.5 %
#>   mpg       +1   0.0568    0.00835 6.81   <0.001 36.5 0.0404 0.0732
#> 
#> Columns: term, contrast, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high 
#> Type:  response

comparisons(mod, by = TRUE)
#> 
#>  Term Contrast Estimate Std. Error    z Pr(>|z|)    S  2.5 % 97.5 %
#>   mpg       +1   0.0568    0.00835 6.81   <0.001 36.5 0.0404 0.0732
#> 
#> Columns: term, contrast, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high 
#> Type:  response
```

## Difference-in-Differences(-in-Differences)

Going back to our Titanic example:

``` r
dat <- "https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/Stat2Data/Titanic.csv"
dat <- read.csv(dat)
titanic <- glm(Survived ~ PClass * SexCode * Age, data = dat, family = binomial)
```

In this case, a contrast is a difference between predicted
probabilities. We can compute that contrast for different types of
individuals:

``` r
comparisons(
  titanic,
  variables = "SexCode",
  newdata = datagrid(PClass = c("1st", "3rd")))
#> 
#>     Term Contrast PClass Estimate Std. Error    z Pr(>|z|)    S 2.5 % 97.5 % SexCode  Age
#>  SexCode    1 - 0    1st    0.483     0.0631 7.65   <0.001 45.5 0.359  0.606   0.381 30.4
#>  SexCode    1 - 0    3rd    0.335     0.0634 5.29   <0.001 22.9 0.211  0.459   0.381 30.4
#> 
#> Columns: rowid, term, contrast, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high, PClass, predicted_lo, predicted_hi, predicted, Survived, SexCode, Age 
#> Type:  response
```

One we can notice above, is that the gap in predicted probabilities of
survival between men and women is larger in 1st class than in 3rd class.
Being a woman matters more for your chances of survival if you travel in
first class. Is the difference between those contrasts (diff-in-diff)
statistically significant?

To answer this question, we can compute a difference-in-difference using
the `hypothesis` argument ([see the Hypothesis vignette for
details](hypothesis.html)). For example, using `b1` and `b2` to refer to
the contrasts in the first and second rows of the output above, we can
test if the difference between the two quantities is different from 0:

``` r
comparisons(
  titanic,
  hypothesis = "b1 - b2 = 0",
  variables = "SexCode",
  newdata = datagrid(PClass = c("1st", "3rd")))
#> 
#>     Term Estimate Std. Error    z Pr(>|z|)   S   2.5 % 97.5 %

#> Columns: term, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high 
#> Type:  response
```

Now, let’s say we consider more types of individuals:

``` r
comparisons(
  titanic,
  variables = "SexCode",
  newdata = datagrid(PClass = c("1st", "3rd"), Age = range))
#> 
#>     Term Contrast PClass   Age Estimate Std. Error      z Pr(>|z|)     S   2.5 % 97.5 % SexCode
#>  SexCode    1 - 0    1st  0.17   0.1081      0.122  0.883   0.3774   1.4 -0.1319  0.348   0.381
#>  SexCode    1 - 0    1st 71.00   0.8795      0.057 15.437   <0.001 176.2  0.7679  0.991   0.381
#>  SexCode    1 - 0    3rd  0.17   0.0805      0.157  0.513   0.6081   0.7 -0.2272  0.388   0.381
#>  SexCode    1 - 0    3rd 71.00   0.4265      0.203  2.101   0.0356   4.8  0.0287  0.824   0.381
#> 
#> Columns: rowid, term, contrast, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high, PClass, Age, predicted_lo, predicted_hi, predicted, Survived, SexCode 
#> Type:  response
```

With these results, we could compute a triple difference:

``` r
comparisons(
  titanic,
  hypothesis = "(b1 - b3) - (b2 - b4) = 0",
  variables = "SexCode",
  newdata = datagrid(PClass = c("1st", "3rd"), Age = range))
#> 
#>               Term Estimate Std. Error     z Pr(>|z|)   S 2.5 % 97.5 %
#>  (b1-b3)-(b2-b4)=0   -0.425      0.359 -1.19    0.236 2.1 -1.13  0.278
#> 
#> Columns: term, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high 
#> Type:  response
```

## Ratios

Instead of taking simple differences between adjusted predictions, it
can sometimes be useful to compute ratios or other functions of
predictions. For example, [the `adjrr` function the `Stata` software
package](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1536867X1301300304)
can compute “adjusted risk ratios”, which are ratios of adjusted
predictions. To do this in `R`, we use the `comparison` argument:

``` r
avg_comparisons(mod, comparison = "ratio")
#> 
#>  Term Contrast Estimate Std. Error    z Pr(>|z|)    S 2.5 % 97.5 %
#>   mpg       +1     1.27      0.124 10.2   <0.001 79.3  1.03   1.52
#> 
#> Columns: term, contrast, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high 
#> Type:  response
```

This result is the average adjusted risk ratio for an increment of 1,
that is, the adjusted predictions when the `mpg` are incremented by 0.5,
divided by the adjusted predictions when `mpg` is decremented by 0.5.

The `comparison` accepts different values for common types of contrasts:
‘difference’, ‘ratio’, ‘lnratio’, ‘ratioavg’, ‘lnratioavg’, ‘lnoravg’,
‘differenceavg’. These strings are shortcuts for functions that accept
two vectors of adjusted predictions and returns a single vector of
contrasts. For example, these two commands yield identical results:

``` r
avg_comparisons(mod, comparison = "ratio")
#> 
#>  Term Contrast Estimate Std. Error    z Pr(>|z|)    S 2.5 % 97.5 %
#>   mpg       +1     1.27      0.124 10.2   <0.001 79.3  1.03   1.52
#> 
#> Columns: term, contrast, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high 
#> Type:  response

avg_comparisons(mod, comparison = function(hi, lo) hi / lo)
#> 
#>  Term Contrast Estimate Std. Error    z Pr(>|z|)    S 2.5 % 97.5 %
#>   mpg       +1     1.27      0.124 10.2   <0.001 79.3  1.03   1.52
#> 
#> Columns: term, contrast, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high 
#> Type:  response
```

This mechanism is powerful, because it lets users create fully
customized contrasts. Here is a non-sensical example:

``` r
avg_comparisons(mod, comparison = function(hi, lo) sqrt(hi) / log(lo + 10))
#> 
#>  Term Contrast Estimate Std. Error    z Pr(>|z|)    S 2.5 % 97.5 %
#>   mpg       +1    0.275     0.0252 10.9   <0.001 89.4 0.225  0.324
#> 
#> Columns: term, contrast, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high 
#> Type:  response
```

The same arguments work in the plotting function `plot_comparisons()` as
well, which allows us to plot various custom contrasts. Here is a
comparison of Adjusted Risk Ratio and Adjusted Risk Difference in a
model of the probability of survival aboard the Titanic:

``` r
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)
titanic <- "https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/Stat2Data/Titanic.csv"
titanic <- read.csv(titanic)
mod_titanic <- glm(
    Survived ~ Sex * PClass + Age + I(Age^2),
    family = binomial,
    data = titanic)

avg_comparisons(mod_titanic)
#> 
#>    Term      Contrast Estimate Std. Error     z Pr(>|z|)     S    2.5 %  97.5 %
#>  Age    +1            -0.00639    0.00107  -6.0   <0.001  28.9 -0.00848 -0.0043
#>  PClass 2nd - 1st     -0.20578    0.03954  -5.2   <0.001  22.3 -0.28328 -0.1283
#>  PClass 3rd - 1st     -0.40428    0.03958 -10.2   <0.001  78.9 -0.48187 -0.3267
#>  Sex    male - female -0.48468    0.03004 -16.1   <0.001 192.2 -0.54355 -0.4258
#> 
#> Columns: term, contrast, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high 
#> Type:  response

p1 <- plot_comparisons(
    mod_titanic,
    variables = "Age",
    condition = "Age",
    comparison = "ratio") +
    ylab("Adjusted Risk Ratio\nP(Survival | Age + 1) / P(Survival | Age)")

p2 <- plot_comparisons(
    mod_titanic,
    variables = "Age",
    condition = "Age") +
    ylab("Adjusted Risk Difference\nP(Survival | Age + 1) - P(Survival | Age)")

p1 + p2
```

By default, the standard errors around contrasts are computed using the
delta method on the scale determined by the `type` argument (e.g.,
“link” or “response”). Some analysts may prefer to proceed differently.
For example, in `Stata`, the `adjrr` computes adjusted risk ratios (ARR)
in two steps:

1.  Compute the natural log of the ratio between the mean of adjusted
    predictions with *x* + 1 and the mean of adjusted predictions with
    *x*.
2.  Exponentiate the estimate and confidence interval bounds.

Step 1 is easy to achieve with the `comparison` argument described
above. Step 2 can be achieved with the `transform` argument:

``` r
avg_comparisons(
    mod,
    comparison = function(hi, lo) log(hi / lo),
    transform = exp)
#> 
#>  Term Contrast Estimate Pr(>|z|)   S 2.5 % 97.5 %
#>   mpg       +1     1.26  0.00863 6.9  1.06   1.49
#> 
#> Columns: term, contrast, estimate, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high 
#> Type:  response
```

Note that we can use the `lnratioavg` shortcut instead of defining the
function ourselves.

The order of operations in previous command was:

1.  Compute the custom unit-level log ratios
2.  Exponentiate them
3.  Take the average using the `avg_comparisons()`

There is a very subtle difference between the procedure above and this
code:

``` r
avg_comparisons(
    mod,
    comparison = function(hi, lo) log(hi / lo),
    transform = exp)
#> 
#>  Term Contrast Estimate Pr(>|z|)   S 2.5 % 97.5 %
#>   mpg       +1     1.26  0.00863 6.9  1.06   1.49
#> 
#> Columns: term, contrast, estimate, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high 
#> Type:  response
```

Since the `exp` function is now passed to the `transform` argument of
the `comparisons()` function, the exponentiation is now done only
*after* unit-level contrasts have been averaged. This is what `Stata`
appears to do under the hood, and the results are slightly different.

``` r
comparisons(
    mod,
    comparison = function(hi, lo) log(mean(hi) / mean(lo)),
    transform = exp)
#> 
#>  Term Contrast Estimate Pr(>|z|)    S 2.5 % 97.5 %
#>   mpg       +1     1.13   <0.001 31.9  1.09   1.17
#> 
#> Columns: term, contrast, estimate, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high, predicted_lo, predicted_hi, predicted 
#> Type:  response
```

Note that equivalent results can be obtained using shortcut strings in
the `comparison` argument: “ratio”, “lnratio”, “lnratioavg”.

``` r
comparisons(
    mod,
    comparison = "lnratioavg",
    transform = exp)
#> 
#>  Term Contrast Estimate Pr(>|z|)    S 2.5 % 97.5 %
#>   mpg mean(+1)     1.13   <0.001 31.9  1.09   1.17
#> 
#> Columns: term, contrast, estimate, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high, predicted_lo, predicted_hi, predicted 
#> Type:  response
```

All the same arguments apply to the plotting functions of the
`marginaleffects` package as well. For example we can plot the Adjusted
Risk Ratio in a model with a quadratic term:

``` r
library(ggplot2)
dat_titanic <- read.csv("https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/Stat2Data/Titanic.csv")
mod2 <- glm(Survived  ~ Age, data = dat_titanic, family = binomial)
plot_comparisons(
    mod2,
    variables = list("Age" = 10),
    condition = "Age",
    comparison = "ratio") +
    ylab("Adjusted Risk Ratio\nP(Survived = 1 | Age + 10) / P(Survived = 1 | Age)")
```

## Forward, Backward, Centered, and Custom Differences

By default, the `comparisons()` function computes a “forward”
difference. For example, if we ask `comparisons()` to estimate the
effect of a 10-unit change in predictor `x` on outcome `y`,
`comparisons()` will compare the predicted values with `x` and `x+10`.

``` r
dat <- mtcars
dat$new_hp <- 49 * (mtcars$hp - min(mtcars$hp)) / (max(mtcars$hp) - min(mtcars$hp)) + 1
mod <- lm(mpg ~ log(new_hp), data = dat)

avg_comparisons(
  mod,
  variables = list(new_hp = 10))
#> 
#>    Term Contrast Estimate Std. Error     z Pr(>|z|)    S 2.5 % 97.5 %
#>  new_hp      +10     -3.8      0.435 -8.74   <0.001 58.6 -4.65  -2.95
#> 
#> Columns: term, contrast, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high 
#> Type:  response
```

We can supply arbitrary functions to create custom differences. These
functions must accept a vector of values for the predictor of interest,
and return a data frame with the same number of rows as the length, and
two columns with the values to compare. For example, we can do:

``` r
forward_diff <- \(x) data.frame(x, x + 10)
backward_diff <- \(x) data.frame(x - 10, x)
center_diff <- \(x) data.frame(x - 5, x + 5)

avg_comparisons(
  mod,
  variables = list(new_hp = forward_diff))
#> 
#>    Term Contrast Estimate Std. Error     z Pr(>|z|)    S 2.5 % 97.5 %
#>  new_hp   custom     -3.8      0.435 -8.74   <0.001 58.6 -4.65  -2.95
#> 
#> Columns: term, contrast, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high 
#> Type:  response

avg_comparisons(
  mod,
  variables = list(new_hp = backward_diff))
#> 
#>    Term Contrast Estimate Std. Error     z Pr(>|z|)    S 2.5 % 97.5 %
#>  new_hp   custom    -6.51      0.744 -8.74   <0.001 58.6 -7.97  -5.05
#> 
#> Columns: term, contrast, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high 
#> Type:  response

avg_comparisons(
  mod,
  variables = list(new_hp = center_diff))
#> 
#>    Term Contrast Estimate Std. Error     z Pr(>|z|)    S 2.5 % 97.5 %
#>  new_hp   custom    -4.06      0.464 -8.74   <0.001 58.6 -4.97  -3.15
#> 
#> Columns: term, contrast, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high 
#> Type:  response
```

Notice that the last “centered” difference gives the same results as the
default `comparisons()` call.

## Lognormal hurdle model

With hurdle models, we can fit two separate models simultaneously:

1.  A model that predicts if the outcome is zero or not zero
2.  If the outcome is not zero, a model that predicts what the value of
    the outcome is

We can calculate predictions and marginal effects for each of these
hurdle model processes, but doing so requires some variable
transformation since the stages of these models use different link
functions.

The `hurdle_lognormal()` family in `brms` uses logistic regression (with
a logit link) for the hurdle part of the model and lognormal regression
(where the outcome is logged before getting used in the model) for the
non-hurdled part. Let’s look at an example of predicting GDP per capita
(which is distributed exponentially) using life expectancy. We’ll add
some artificial zeros so that we can work with a hurdle stage of the
model.

``` r
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)
library(brms)
library(marginaleffects)
library(gapminder)

## Build some 0s into the GDP column
set.seed(1234)
gapminder <- gapminder::gapminder |> 
  filter(continent != "Oceania") |> 
  # Make a bunch of GDP values 0
  mutate(prob_zero = ifelse(lifeExp < 50, 0.3, 0.02),
         will_be_zero = rbinom(n(), 1, prob = prob_zero),
         gdpPercap0 = ifelse(will_be_zero, 0, gdpPercap)) |> 
  select(-prob_zero, -will_be_zero)

mod <- brm(
  bf(gdpPercap0 ~ lifeExp,
     hu ~ lifeExp),
  data = gapminder,
  family = hurdle_lognormal(),
  chains = 4, cores = 4, seed = 1234)
```

We have two different sets of coefficients here for the two different
processes. The hurdle part (`hu`) uses a logit link, and the non-hurdle
part (`mu`) uses an identity link. However, that’s a slight misnomer—a
true identity link would show the coefficients on a non-logged dollar
value scale. Because we’re using a `lognormal` family, GDP per capita is
pre-logged, so the “original” identity scale is actually logged dollars.

``` r
summary(mod)
```

    #>  Family: hurdle_lognormal 
    #>   Links: mu = identity; sigma = identity; hu = logit 
    #> Formula: gdpPercap0 ~ lifeExp 
    #>          hu ~ lifeExp
    #>    Data: gapminder (Number of observations: 1680) 
    #>   Draws: 4 chains, each with iter = 2000; warmup = 1000; thin = 1;
    #>          total post-warmup draws = 4000

    #> hu_Intercept     3.16      0.40     2.37     3.96 1.00     2773     2679

    #> ...

We can get predictions for the `hu` part of the model on the link
(logit) scale:

``` r
predictions(mod, dpar = "hu", type = "link",
            newdata = datagrid(lifeExp = seq(40, 80, 20)))
#> 
#>  lifeExp Estimate 2.5 % 97.5 %
#>       40   -0.817 -1.03 -0.604
#>       60   -2.805 -3.06 -2.555
#>       80   -4.790 -5.34 -4.275
#> 
#> Columns: rowid, estimate, conf.low, conf.high, gdpPercap0, lifeExp 
#> Type:  link
```

…or on the response (percentage point) scale:

``` r
predictions(mod, dpar = "hu", type = "response",
            newdata = datagrid(lifeExp = seq(40, 80, 20)))
#> 
#>  lifeExp Estimate   2.5 % 97.5 %
#>       40  0.30630 0.26231 0.3534
#>       60  0.05703 0.04466 0.0721
#>       80  0.00824 0.00478 0.0137
#> 
#> Columns: rowid, estimate, conf.low, conf.high, gdpPercap0, lifeExp 
#> Type:  response
```

We can also get slopes for the `hu` part of the model on the link
(logit) or response (percentage point) scales:

``` r
slopes(mod, dpar = "hu", type = "link",
                newdata = datagrid(lifeExp = seq(40, 80, 20)))
#> 
#>     Term lifeExp Estimate  2.5 %  97.5 %
#>  lifeExp      40  -0.0993 -0.116 -0.0837
#>  lifeExp      60  -0.0993 -0.116 -0.0837
#>  lifeExp      80  -0.0993 -0.116 -0.0837
#> 
#> Columns: rowid, term, estimate, conf.low, conf.high, lifeExp, predicted_lo, predicted_hi, predicted, tmp_idx, gdpPercap0 
#> Type:  link

slopes(mod, dpar = "hu", type = "response",
                newdata = datagrid(lifeExp = seq(40, 80, 20)))
#> 
#>     Term lifeExp  Estimate    2.5 %    97.5 %
#>  lifeExp      40 -0.021080 -0.02592 -0.016590
#>  lifeExp      60 -0.005322 -0.00615 -0.004562
#>  lifeExp      80 -0.000812 -0.00115 -0.000543
#> 
#> Columns: rowid, term, estimate, conf.low, conf.high, lifeExp, predicted_lo, predicted_hi, predicted, tmp_idx, gdpPercap0 
#> Type:  response
```

Working with the `mu` part of the model is trickier. Switching between
`type = "link"` and `type = "response"` doesn’t change anything, since
the outcome is pre-logged:

``` r
predictions(mod, dpar = "mu", type = "link",
            newdata = datagrid(lifeExp = seq(40, 80, 20)))
#> 
#>  lifeExp Estimate 2.5 % 97.5 %
#>       40     6.61  6.54   6.69
#>       60     8.18  8.15   8.22
#>       80     9.75  9.69   9.82
#> 
#> Columns: rowid, estimate, conf.low, conf.high, gdpPercap0, lifeExp 
#> Type:  link
predictions(mod, dpar = "mu", type = "response",
            newdata = datagrid(lifeExp = seq(40, 80, 20)))
#> 
#>  lifeExp Estimate 2.5 % 97.5 %
#>       40     6.61  6.54   6.69
#>       60     8.18  8.15   8.22
#>       80     9.75  9.69   9.82
#> 
#> Columns: rowid, estimate, conf.low, conf.high, gdpPercap0, lifeExp 
#> Type:  response
```

For **predictions**, we need to exponentiate the results to scale them
back up to dollar amounts. We can do this by post-processing the results
(e.g. with `dplyr::mutate(predicted = exp(predicted))`), or we can use
the `transform` argument in `predictions()` to pass the results to
`exp()` after getting calculated:

``` r
predictions(mod, dpar = "mu", 
            newdata = datagrid(lifeExp = seq(40, 80, 20)),
            transform = exp)
#> 
#>  lifeExp Estimate 2.5 % 97.5 %
#>       40      744   694    801
#>       60     3581  3449   3718
#>       80    17215 16110  18410
#> 
#> Columns: rowid, estimate, conf.low, conf.high, gdpPercap0, lifeExp 
#> Type:  response
```

We can pass `transform = exp` to `plot_predictions()` too:

``` r
plot_predictions(
  mod,
  dpar = "hu",
  type = "link",

For **marginal effects**, we need to transform the predictions *before*
calculating the instantaneous slopes. We also can’t use the `slopes()`
function directly—we need to use `comparisons()` and compute the
numerical derivative ourselves (i.e. predict `gdpPercap` at `lifeExp` of
40 and 40.001 and calculate the slope between those predictions). We can
use the `comparison` argument to pass the pair of predicted values to
`exp()` before calculating the slopes:

``` r
## step size of the numerical derivative
eps <- 0.001

comparisons(
  mod,
  dpar = "mu",
  variables = list(lifeExp = eps),
  newdata = datagrid(lifeExp = seq(40, 80, 20)),
  # rescale the elements of the slope
  # (exp(40.001) - exp(40)) / exp(0.001)
  comparison = function(hi, lo) ((exp(hi) - exp(lo)) / exp(eps)) / eps
)
#> 
#>     Term Contrast lifeExp Estimate  2.5 % 97.5 %
#>  lifeExp   +0.001      40     58.4   55.8     61
#>  lifeExp   +0.001      60    280.9  266.6    296
#>  lifeExp   +0.001      80   1349.5 1222.6   1490
#> 
#> Columns: rowid, term, contrast, estimate, conf.low, conf.high, lifeExp, predicted_lo, predicted_hi, predicted, tmp_idx, gdpPercap0 
#> Type:  response
```

We can visually confirm that these are the instantaneous slopes at each
of these levels of life expectancy:

``` r
predictions_data <- predictions(
  mod,
  newdata = datagrid(lifeExp = seq(30, 80, 1)),
  dpar = "mu",
  transform = exp) |>
  select(lifeExp, prediction = estimate)

slopes_data <- comparisons(
  mod,
  dpar = "mu",
  variables = list(lifeExp = eps),
  newdata = datagrid(lifeExp = seq(40, 80, 20)),
  comparison = function(hi, lo) ((exp(hi) - exp(lo)) / exp(eps)) / eps) |>
  select(lifeExp, estimate) |>
  left_join(predictions_data, by = "lifeExp") |>
  # Point-slope formula: (y - y1) = m(x - x1)
  mutate(intercept = estimate * (-lifeExp) + prediction)

ggplot(predictions_data, aes(x = lifeExp, y = prediction)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) + 
  geom_abline(data = slopes_data, aes(slope = estimate, intercept = intercept), 
              size = 0.5, color = "red") +
  geom_point(data = slopes_data) +
  geom_label(data = slopes_data, aes(label = paste0("Slope: ", round(estimate, 1))),
             nudge_x = -1, hjust = 1) +
  theme_minimal()
```
