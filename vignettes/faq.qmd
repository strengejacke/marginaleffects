## Calling `marginaleffects` in functions, loops, environments, or after re-assigning variables

Functions from the `marginaleffects` package can sometimes fail when they are called inside a function, loop, or other environments. To see why, it is important to know that `marginaleffects` often needs to operate on the original data that was used to fit the model. To extract this original data, we use the `get_data()` function from the `insight` package.

In most cases, `get_data()` can extract the data which is stored inside the model object created by the modeling package. However, some modeling packages do *not* save the original data in the model object (in order to save memory). In those cases, `get_data()` will parse the call to find the name of the data object, and will search for that data object in the global environment. When users fit models in a different environment (e.g., function calls), `get_data()` may not be able to retrieve the original data.

A related problem can arise if users fit a model, but then assign a new value to the variable that used to store the dataset.

Recommendations:

1. Supply your dataset explicitly to the `newdata` argument of `slopes` functions.
2. Avoid assigning a new value to a variable that you use to store a dataset for model fitting.
